Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. More than teaching how to program in one language, this course showed me how to program fundamentally and how to teach myself new languages. I learned to program in C and Python, how to design, query, and process SQL databases, and to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, teaching me to create web and mobile apps alike. I also gained an understanding of computer hardware, industry best practices, and memory allocation. The course culminates in a final project, for which I created a Flask application.",

I learned how to handle exceptions, use third-party libraries, validate and extract data with regular expressions, model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties, and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice, and exercises inspired by real-world programming problems enhanced my understanding and appreciation of the Python language.",

The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. It also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery.",

AceternityUI allows developers to incorporate the most trending components.
